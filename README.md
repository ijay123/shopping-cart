* This shopping cart task is to list products for selling and adding to cart. Then the products are checked out to find the sub total of all products added to cart. 

* The website is built using reactJS framework with tailwindcss for styling.

* For simplicity , the codebase has been kept minimal and only includes necessary components to demonstrate functionality of the app. 

* It uses the useState and useEffect hooks.

* I used react-router-dom to navigate  between different pages of the application.

* For storage of data , I used localStorage which stores user information and all cart history in the browser's memory.

* The component folder in the src folder contains all components representing the pages of the website.

* The check-out component is the page displaying all cart items added to cart, the dataset component is a JavaScript file displaying all the products on the home page of the website.

* The Footer component is resuable. Displaying the information and services concerning the owner of the website.

* The home page displays all the products added in the dataset file. it is mapped through a map function to display each product.

* The Header/Navigation component is a reusable component that represents the navigation bar on every page, it includes links to Home and cart list/checkout page

### Installation

* I installed tailwindcss, react-router-dom , react-icons, dotenv  by running `npm install --save tailwindcss react-router-dom react-icons in my application
